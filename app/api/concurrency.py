"""
Concurrency guards for hot-path endpoints.

`max_concurrent_pipelines` is declared in settings but was never enforced
before — a burst of 50 simultaneous /chat requests would all start
embedding + LLM calls in parallel and OOM the 1.5 GB uvicorn worker.
This module turns the setting into a real asyncio.Semaphore and exposes
two helpers:

  - `acquire_pipeline_slot()` for non-streaming endpoints: returns the
    semaphore, release in `finally`.
  - `acquire_pipeline_slot_or_503()`: for streaming endpoints that need
    the slot held for the entire SSE lifetime. Returns a release
    callable so the generator's `finally` can let go when the stream
    ends or the client disconnects.

A 5s acquire timeout matches the original setting; on saturation the
route returns 503 with `Retry-After: 5` so clients back off cleanly
instead of queueing invisibly.
